## Data Scientist/Engineer and Software developer

ðŸ”­ Currently working as a Junior Data Scientist II at Aily Labs in Madrid, Spain, developing AI-powered solutions with a focus on NLP and Machine Learning. Recently completed my Master's in Business Analytics and Big Data from IE School of Science and Technology.

ðŸŒŽ Check out my [portfolio](https://www.felipebasurto.com/)

I'm always doing some side projects, but I can't be bothered to keep my portfolio up to date. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some data visualizations, Spark Streaming and ML apis and starting my job search.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love making music and I have a pop-rock band with a decent amount of fans.

Feel free to reach out ðŸ’¬
